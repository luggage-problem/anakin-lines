            "Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer. Protection is a job for local security, not jedi. It's overkill master, investigation is implied in our mandate.",
            "She hardly even recognized me Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted, and she's forgotten me completely.",
            "Quite as a tune. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.",

            "I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.",
            "We need a system where the polticians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.",
            "Well then they should be made to.",

            "Ah well, negotiations with a lightsaber.",
            "If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this he'd be very grumpy.",
            "From the moment I met you, all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you... I can't breath. I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything that you ask. If you are suffering as much as I am please tell me.",
            "Anything is possible just listen to me.",
            "Then you do feel something.",
            "You're asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish I could just wish away my feelings, but I can't.",
            "Well you know it... wouldn't have to be that way. We could keep it a secret.",
            "No. You're right. It would destroy us.",

            "I... I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead. Every single one of them. And not just the men. But the women. And the children too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I hate them. ",
            "I'm a jedi. I know I'm better than this. ",
            "I wasn't strong enough to save you mom. I wasn't strong enough. But I promise, I won't fail again.",

            "You love me? I thought that we had decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie, and that it would destroy our lives.",
            "I retransmitted it just as you had requested Master. Then we decided to come rescue you.",

            "But the council elects its own members, they'll never accept this.",
            "I understand.",
            "What?",
            "How can you do this? This is outrageous. It's unfair. How can you be on the council and not be a master?",
            "Forgive me, master.",
            "What kind of nonsense is this? Put me on the council and not make me a master? It's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting.",
            "I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the council.",
            "That has nothing to do with this.",
            "And?",
            "What situation?",
            "They want me to spy on the Chancellor? But that's treason.",
            "Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?",
            "The chancellor is not a bad man Obi-Wan. He befriended me, he's watched over me ever since I arrived here.",
            "The senate demanded that he stay longer.",
            "You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code. Against the Republic, against a mentor, and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?",
            "Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi order. I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.",
            "What do you mean?",
            "I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a separatist.",
            "Don't ask me to do that. Make a motion in the senate, where that kind of a request belongs.",
            "Nothing.",
            "You wanted to see me chancellor.",
            "At last. We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.",
            "I'm not sure I understand.",
            "I don't think that.",
            "I know they don't trust you.",
            "I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken.",
            "I don't… I don't know what to say.",
            "The Jedi use their power for good.",
            "The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards, only about themselves.",
            "The Jedi are selfless. They only care about others.",
            "No.",
            "He could actually save people from death?",
            "What happened to him?",
            "Is it possible to learn this power?",
            "A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of Utapau.",
            "The chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.",
            "You're gonna need me on this one master.",
            "Master, I've disappointed you. I haven't been very appreciative of your training. I've been arrogant and I apologize. I've just been so frustrated with the council.",
            "Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.",
            "Obi-Wan's been here hasn't he.",
            "What did he want?",
            "I feel lost.",
            "Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.",
            "Something's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't.",
            "I found a way to save you.",
            "From my nightmares.",
            "I won't lose you, Padme.",
            "No I promise you.",
            "Yes master.",
            "Chancellor. We have just received a report from General Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.",
            "I should be there with him.",
            "I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I'm being excluded from the council. I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me.",
            "How do you know the ways of the Force?",
            "You know the Dark Side?",
            "What did you say?",
            "You're the Sith lord.",
            "I would certainly like to.",
            "I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi council.",
            "I will quickly discover the truth of all this.",
            "Master Windu, I must talk to you.",
            "He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.",
            "Yes. The one we've been looking for.",
            "He knows the ways of the force. He's been trained to use the dark side.",
            "Absolutely.",
            "Master, the chancellor is very powerful. You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him.",
            "I must go, master.",
            "Yes, master.",
            "No, he must stand trial.",
            "It's not the Jedi way. He must live.",
            "I need him.",
            "What have I done?",
            "I will do whatever you ask.",
            "Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her.",
            "I pledge myself to your teachings.",
            "Thank you, my master.",
            "I agree. The council's next move will be against the senate.",
            "I understand, master.",
            "What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?",
            "I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.",
            "The Jedi have tried to overthrow the republic.",
            "I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself.",
            "I will not betray the republic. My loyalties lie with the chancellor, and with the senate, and with you.",
            "I don't know. Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.",
            "Have faith my love. Everything will soon be set right. The chancellor has given me a very important mission. The separatists have gathered on the Mustafa system. I'm going there to end  this war. Wait for me until I return. Things will be different I promise. Please, wait for me.",
            "R2, stay with the ship.",
            "The separatists have been taken care of, my master.",
            "Very good, my lord.",
            "I saw your ship. What are you doing out here?",
            "What things?",
            "Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.",
            "Us?",
            "Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.",
            "I won't lose you the way I lost my mother. I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I'm doing it for you. To protect you.",
            "Don't you see? We don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the republic. I am more powerful than the chancellor. I can overthrow him. And together you and I can rule the galaxy, make things the way we want them to be.",
            "I don't want to hear anymore about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.",
            "Because of Obi-Wan?",
            "Liar!",
            "You're with him! You brought him here to kill me.",
            "You turned her against me!",
            "You will not take her from me!",
            "Don't lecture me Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new empire.",
            "Don't make me kill you.",
            "If you're not with me then you're my enemy.",
            "You will try.",
            "I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over.",
            "From my point of view the Jedi are evil.",
            "This is the end for you, my master.",
            "You underestimate my power.",
            "I hate you!",
            "Yes, master. Where is Padme? Is she safe? Is she all right?",
            "I? I couldn't have. She was alive. I felt it!",
            "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!"
